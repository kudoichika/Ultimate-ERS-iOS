A realtime iOS game of ERS!

ERS stands for Egpytian Rat Slap (or Rat Screw/other names) and is a pretty fun and challenging card game (if you have really tough opponents, like I did in high school). I built this game as a way to play with friends over quarantine and as a way to hone my skills so they don't grow numb.

The supported multiplayer server is located in the [Ultimate-ERS-Server](https://github.com/kudoichika/Ultimate-ERS-Server) repo.

### Features
- Single player game with 2-4 "AI" opponents that can have a chosen difficulty ranging from 1-5
- Multiplayer 2-player game with realtime competition support using the custom built game server
- Customizable with 13 different kinds of slap pattern rules (Adding some popular home rules)
