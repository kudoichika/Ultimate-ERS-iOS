# Ultimate ERS Â· [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
A realtime iOS multiplayer game/server for ERS!

ERS stands for Egpytian Rat Slap (or Rat Screw/other names) and is a pretty fun and challenging card game (if you have really tough opponents, like I did in high school). I built this game as a way to play with friends over quarantine and as a way to hone my skills so they don't grow numb.

The supported multiplayer server is located in the [server](https://github.com/usjpin/ultimate-ers/tree/master/Multiplayer-Server) folder.

### Game Features
- Single player game with 2-4 "AI" opponents that can have a chosen difficulty ranging from 1-5
- Multiplayer 2-player game with realtime competition support using the custom built game server
- Customizable with 13 different kinds of slap pattern rules (Added some of the popular home rules)

### Highlights

### Server Features
- Support CRUD of user accounts and stores their game history
- Supports upto 2 players per game room (rooms are basically unlimited until the server runs out of memory)
- Supports realtime action between client devices (as ERS is a realtime game - gotta get those slaps fast)

### Client Technology
- Uses Swift and Apple SpriteKit & UIKit to control gameplay/graphics
- Uses Socket.IO-Swift to communicate with the multiplayer server backend
- Requests to perform basic CRUD and retrieve game history

### Server Technology
- The classic JavaScript Node-Express-MongoDB stack for the backend framework
- Uses Socket.IO (with websockets/no pooling) to maintain realtime connection and updates
- Passport.js to simplify authentication
- Other libraries for cookie storage and MongoDB interfacing
- Chalk for some cool colored game/server logs
